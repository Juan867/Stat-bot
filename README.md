Project: Stat Bot

This repo contains a minimal working Discord Bot for MP3 project for Intro to Engineering ;)

I need this project to do mean,median,mode and std. It needs to be able to take a large list of numbers and it has to be able to react when someone puts mean,median,mode or std for their list of numbers. It should have a breif discription of what each does. I need it to work on discord.
